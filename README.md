## My Process

### Built With

Based on the provided code and your project details, here's the updated "Built With" section of the README:

- **HTML5:** Utilized semantic HTML5 elements for structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** Implemented modern CSS techniques for styling.
  - **CSS Grid:** Used for creating a responsive layout for the feature section.
  - **Flexbox:** Applied for alignment and spacing within the card container.
  - **Custom Properties (CSS Variables):** Used to manage colors and other reusable values.
- **Mobile-First Design:** Designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness across devices.
- **Google Fonts:** Integrated [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) for typography.

### What I Learned

In this project, I enhanced my skills in creating responsive layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox. A key learning point was managing different screen sizes effectively with CSS Grid, as shown in this CSS snippet:

```css
.main {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 25px;
}
```

This approach allowed for a clean, adaptable design across various devices.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I plan to focus more on:

- Enhancing accessibility features.
- Integrating animations for a more interactive user experience.
- Exploring advanced CSS techniques for complex layouts.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This resource helped me understand how to effectively use CSS Grid.
- [CSS Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide was instrumental in mastering Flexbox layouts.
